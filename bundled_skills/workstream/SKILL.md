# Workstream

Run implementation work as one coherent flow. This skill coordinates existing
skills; it does not replace them.

## Skill Chain

- `survey`: activate before planning when repository structure, commands, or validation paths are not already known.
- `planning`: activate for intake, specification, clarification, artifact analysis, tradeoffs, success criteria, and plan docs.
- `queue`: activate to convert plan work items into a Taskwarrior task draft.
- `taskwarrior`: activate before creating, reading, modifying, or completing tasks.
- `verify`: activate before choosing or running validation checks, and before marking implementation tasks done.
- `close`: activate for closeout before final status or commit preparation.
- `git-commit`: activate only when the user explicitly requested staging or commits.

## Operating Model

Treat intent artifacts as executable contracts, not disposable notes. Keep the
workflow proportionate: add structure only when it reduces ambiguity, rework,
or validation risk.

### Work-Unit Commits

During intake, determine whether the current working directory belongs to a Git
worktree. Do not initialize a repository. Commit completed work units only when
the current user request explicitly authorizes staging or commits.

- A work unit is one independently verifiable `WI` after its mapped task-local
  validation passes. When dependent work items or inseparable hunks must stay
  atomic, commit the smallest coherent group and record the grouping rationale.
- Treat convergence fixes as work units after affected validation passes.
- Before every commit, activate `git-commit`, inspect the full worktree, stage only
  the current unit, and preserve unrelated user changes.
- After every successful commit, append its hash, subject, and covered `WI` or
  fix group to an ordered workstream commit list in the phase-ledger evidence.
  Preserve this list across resume and compaction; do not reconstruct it from
  the final `HEAD` alone.
- If `git-commit` reports an unsafe or unseparable state, keep the affected work
  item incomplete and surface the blocker. Do not silently defer its commit to
  closeout.
- Outside a Git worktree, continue without commits and do not create a
  repository merely to enable them.

### Artifact Depth

Choose exactly one depth during intake and record it with rationale in the plan.
Apply precedence `High-risk > Standard > Light`; risk overrides small size.

- **Light**: use one `plan.md` only when behavior is already explicit and the
  change is local, reversible, low risk, and does not match a higher depth.
- **Standard**: add `spec.md` before `plan.md` for material user-visible
  behavior, public contracts, multiple acceptance paths, or material ambiguity.
- **High-risk**: use `spec.md` plus explicit non-functional, migration,
  rollback/recovery, security/privacy, and observability requirements for auth,
  permissions, persistent data, migrations, destructive operations, external
  integrations, or broad shared infrastructure.

Reuse an existing issue, RFC, spec, or design document as the intent source
when it is authoritative and complete enough. Do not create a duplicate spec.
When the user explicitly invokes workstream for a tiny edit, keep it light only
if all Light conditions hold; tiny auth, migration, permission, destructive, or
persistent-data work remains High-risk.

### Canonical Identity and Paths

Before resolving any artifact or task project, use `skill_read` with `action: resource`
to read `references/path-contract.md` completely, then call `project action=status`.
Unless the user supplied a full slug, choose a
three-to-five-token semantic English slug base from the settled Goal and pass
it to `project action=init`; include a concrete domain/object and outcome,
especially when the Goal is non-English. Use the returned slug exactly. Never
calculate its hash, scan for repository plan conventions, choose a filesystem
path, or add a collision suffix.

### Intent and Traceability

Use stable IDs in newly created workstream artifacts:

- `REQ-###`: required behavior or constraint.
- `AC-###`: observable acceptance criterion; reference its `REQ-###`.
- `WI-###`: independently verifiable work item; reference covered requirements
  and acceptance criteria.
- `VAL-###`: validation check; reference the work item, acceptance criterion,
  or material risk it proves, and classify it as `task-local` or `standalone`.

Preserve existing repository ID schemes instead of renumbering them. Every
requirement must have an acceptance signal, every buildable requirement must map
to work, and every work item must map to validation. Do not create work for
post-launch business outcomes that cannot be proven during implementation.

### Governance

Treat applicable `AGENTS.md`, repository rules, architecture docs, contribution
guides, security policies, and user constraints as governing sources. Extract
their relevant MUST/SHOULD rules into the plan's `Governance Check`; a separate
constitution file is optional. Stop before queueing when a MUST rule is violated
or a material exception lacks explicit rationale and user authority.

### Phase Ledger

Keep a compact phase ledger in `plan.md` with phase, status, evidence, and next
entry point. Update it after phase transitions and before interruption or
handoff. The ledger preserves workflow continuity; Taskwarrior remains
authoritative for individual task state. Never duplicate every task update into
the ledger.

### Deterministic Status Reporting

Report observable state, not estimated progress. Never emit an overall
percentage, weighted completion estimate, remaining-effort percentage, or
`official progress` label. Task, WI, AC, VAL, and phase counts measure different
things and must not be combined or presented as elapsed or remaining effort.

Send a status snapshot immediately after any of these events:

- a Taskwarrior task completes;
- a planned `VAL` receives a new pass, fail, blocked, skipped, or
  skipped-with-accepted-risk result;
- the active phase or blocker changes;
- the same planned check fails again after a fix attempt.

Build every snapshot only from the current phase ledger, Taskwarrior queue, plan
IDs, and recorded validation evidence. For a current `VAL` status, use its most
recent evidence row plus any matching accepted-gap record while retaining
earlier rows as history. Never invent
sub-checkpoints, weights, completion fractions, or effort estimates during
execution. If no planned check changed, report concrete evidence produced and
say the task remains active without numeric movement.

Use this shape, omitting empty lines:

```text
Status:
- Phase: <ledger phase>
- Completed: <task ID and title completed since prior snapshot|none>
- Current: <active task ID and title|none>
- Checks: <VAL-ID result[, ...]>; remaining <planned VAL IDs|none>
- Blocker: <recorded blocker|none>
- Next: <next exact action or ready task|closeout>
```

Do not show `done/total` by default. When the user explicitly asks for queue or
check counts, label them `queue count` or `validation count`, omit percentages,
and state that counts do not represent effort or time remaining. When
convergence adds tasks or checks, state the exact IDs added; do not recalculate
or reinterpret prior status as progress.

## Flow

1. Intake
   - Settle the one-sentence Goal, then clarify scope, non-goals, constraints,
     success criteria, and validation expectations.
   - Choose light, standard, or high-risk artifact depth from evidence, not task
     size alone.
   - Record the settled outcome in the plan and phase ledger before execution.
   - Run `survey` first when codebase shape, commands, governing sources, or relevant paths are unknown.
   - Ask only for material unknowns. Make conservative assumptions for routine, reversible details.

2. Specify and Clarify
   - For standard/high-risk work, create or update `spec.md` beside the plan, or
     link the authoritative existing intent source.
   - Keep behavior and constraints in the spec; keep solution choices in the
     plan. Existing public-contract facts may appear in both when needed for
     precision.
   - Cover actors, primary/alternate/error/recovery flows, data lifecycle,
     boundary conditions, compatibility, and applicable non-functional needs.
   - Scan unresolved areas by impact: scope, security/privacy, data integrity,
     UX, external failure, performance/reliability, migration/rollback, and
     observability.
   - Ask one focused question at a time only when the answer materially changes
     behavior, architecture, task decomposition, or validation. Keep unresolved
     decisions in conversation and integrate each settled answer immediately.
   - Self-check that requirements are bounded, unambiguous, measurable, and
     free of contradictory placeholders before planning.

3. Plan
   - When the user asks for `workstream` planning, create or update a plan doc by default.
   - Do not satisfy `workstream 계획`, `workstream plan`, or `작업흐름 계획` with conversation-only bullets unless the user says `대화로만`, `문서 쓰지 말고`, or equivalent.
   - After Goal, depth, and intent source are settled, call `project action=init`.
     State its exact slug and fixed artifact names before writing the plan.
   - Accept a full-slug override only when the user explicitly provides it.
     Otherwise pass the semantic slug base required by the path contract and
     let Loki append the Goal hash. If resolution, collision, semantic quality, or write checks
     fail, stop; do not fall back to another path.
   - Translate intent into technical decisions, exact implementation surfaces,
     independently verifiable work items, validation, risks, and governance checks.
   - In `Constraints`, record only active context-preservation rules that must
     survive resume: active style mode, durable user constraints, unexpired
     task-local constraints, commit policy, validation policy, and current
     protected paths. Include scope and reason for durable prohibitions and
     scope plus expiry for task-local constraints.
   - Normalize preferences and selected designs into positive canonical state.
     Keep rejected proposals, superseded alternatives, and expired constraints
     out of plans, ledgers, queues, and handoffs unless
     an explicit audit artifact requires their history.
   - Write settled facts only. Keep unresolved decisions in conversation.
   - Do not add an `Open Decisions` section by default. If a repo template or
     explicit user request requires one, follow `planning` open-decision
     criteria and include only material unresolved decisions.
   - Initialize or refresh the phase ledger, then summarize path + main work items briefly.

4. Analyze Artifacts
   - Before queueing, perform a read-only consistency and coverage pass over the
     intent source, plan, governing rules, work items, and validation.
   - Check duplicate/conflicting requirements, vague or untestable acceptance
     criteria, governance violations, uncovered `REQ/AC`, unmapped `WI`, missing
     `VAL`, impossible ordering, file-path or terminology drift, and stale
     rejected or expired context outside an explicit audit artifact.
   - Treat governing MUST violations, contradictory intent, unresolved
     security/data/migration/public-contract decisions, and missing coverage or
     validation for baseline behavior as blockers. Other gaps may be deferred
     only with explicit user risk acceptance.
   - Report evidence and severity. Do not silently rewrite intent to make the analysis pass.
   - Correct settled artifact inconsistencies in scope, keep real decisions in
     conversation, and rerun analysis. Queue only when zero blockers remain.
     Explicit risk acceptance can defer non-blocking findings only.
   - For plan-only requests, stop here after reporting the analyzed artifacts.
     Never create a Taskwarrior queue, mutate code, verify an
     implementation, or close an execution workstream.

5. Queue
   - Use `queue` to extract actionable `Work Items` from the analyzed plan.
   - Use `taskwarrior` for all workstream task reads, creation, updates, and completion.
   - Add the Taskwarrior queue before implementation starts; do not substitute an in-memory checklist for durable project-wide task state.
   - Workstream task creation, annotation, dependency wiring, start/stop, and completion are pre-approved non-destructive project-wide mutations. Proceed without asking for confirmation when scope is unambiguous.
   - Show a concise user-language queue summary before mutation, then execute.
   - Preserve `WI/REQ/AC` source IDs in task descriptions or annotations. Include
     exact paths and validation IDs when known.
   - Create one implementation task per `WI`. Keep task-local acceptance checks
     as mapped `VAL` evidence run before that WI is done. Create a standalone
     validation task only for broader or cross-WI checks; it depends on the
     relevant WI tasks. Keep Close phase-only so it can inspect a clear queue
     rather than depend on itself.
   - Register only explicit `WI` and standalone `VAL` entries. Do not synthesize
     extra terminal phases or tasks.
   - Use the resolver's exact `project:<slug>` plus tags such as
     `+survey`, `+implementation`, `+validation`, `+risk`.
   - Use Taskwarrior `depends:` for strict task order. Mark work parallel-safe
     only when it touches different files/resources and has no incomplete dependency.
   - Prefer one task per independently verifiable work item; do not create tasks
     for headings, open decisions, or non-buildable outcome metrics.
   - Queues are repository-wide across worktrees. Initialize them only through
     `project`; never create a worktree-local queue or ledger, global tasks,
     or another state root. Repository-owned `.tasks` build and validation output
     is outside the project-state contract.

6. Execute
   - Work from the ready task queue using the resolver's exact project, normally
     `task_inspect action=next` with cwd and the exact workstream.
   - Refresh reports before using numeric IDs. Prefer UUIDs for multi-step updates.
   - Start or annotate tasks when useful. After a WI's mapped task-local
     acceptance checks pass, commit that work unit when operating in a Git
     worktree, then mark the WI task done and report a deterministic status
     snapshot immediately.
     Never wait on a standalone validation task that depends on that WI.
   - Respect dependencies and file conflicts. Keep edits scoped to the active
     task, intent, and plan.

7. Verify
   - Use `verify` to map every work item, acceptance criterion, and material risk to a check.
   - Treat tests and relevant validation as required by risk and behavior, even
     when the original request does not explicitly ask for tests.
   - Run targeted checks first, then broader checks for shared or risky changes.
   - A failed or unavailable task-local VAL keeps its WI pending or blocked and
     cannot be deferred as complete. A failed standalone VAL stays pending and
     becomes corrective convergence work; during focused Queue re-entry, add
     dependencies from that failed VAL task to its corrective WI and any new
     prerequisite VAL so `+READY` selects the repair first. An
     unavailable/skipped standalone VAL stays pending
     unless the user explicitly accepts the risk; then annotate it with the
     reason and acceptance, mark that validation task done, and preserve the gap
     in the ledger and closeout.
   - Write the canonical validation evidence to the resolver's `validation.md`.
     Record its path in the phase ledger. Do not reopen a completed WI to
     mirror standalone status unless evidence invalidates its task-local
     acceptance; use convergence for corrective work. After completing any
     standalone validation task, report a deterministic status snapshot
     immediately. Also report when any planned VAL result changes or repeats
     after a fix attempt, even if its Taskwarrior task remains active.

8. Converge
   - After implementation and relevant validation, compare current code and
     observable behavior against `REQ/AC`, plan decisions, governing MUST rules,
     and completed Taskwarrior work.
   - Bound inspection to current-workstream changes, planned implementation
     surfaces, and direct contracts. Do not classify unrelated pre-existing
     behavior as unrequested work.
   - Classify evidence-backed gaps as `missing`, `partial`, `contradicts`, or
     `unrequested`. Report unrequested behavior; never delete it automatically.
   - If actionable gaps exist, append new stable `WI/VAL` entries without
     rewriting, renumbering, or reopening completed history to hide the gap.
     Re-enter a focused `Analyze Artifacts -> Queue` pass before registering the
     new project-wide tasks.
   - Continue `Execute -> Verify -> Converge` after the focused analysis and
     queue pass until no actionable intent gap remains. The same unresolved root
     cause after two fix attempts becomes a user decision/blocker, not an infinite loop.
   - If no gap remains, record convergence evidence in the phase ledger.

9. Close
   - Check intent satisfaction, artifact analysis, convergence, plan/task
     status, validation results, phase ledger, git status, and residual risk.
   - In a Git worktree, confirm every completed work unit has a corresponding
     `git-commit` result. Commit any validated closeout-only change as its own
     work unit before declaring completion.
   - Verify every recorded workstream commit against Git before the final
     response. Report all workstream-created commits in creation order as
     `<short-hash> <subject> — <WI or fix group>`; never collapse the report to
     only the final commit. Exclude pre-existing and unrelated commits. If the
     workstream created none, report `Commits: none`.

## Adoption Boundaries

- Do not create or switch branches unless the user requests branch work.
- Do not require fixed human approval gates when intent is settled and the next
  action is safe; ask only for material decisions or required authority.
- Do not make tests optional merely because the request omitted the word
  `test`; choose validation from behavior and risk.
- Do not add a generic hook, preset, or plugin system to a repository merely to
  run this workflow.
- Do not let analysis or convergence replace runtime verification. They answer
  different questions.

## Artifact Contracts

Before creating or updating workstream artifacts, use `skill_read` with `action: resource` to
read both `references/path-contract.md` and `references/artifact-contracts.md` completely.
Use the fixed paths from the resolver and the relevant content contract.

## Task Draft

Use `queue` for the authoritative registration format. Keep raw Taskwarrior
commands and dependency lines internal unless the user asks or mutation risk
requires explicit inspection. For workstream execution, Taskwarrior queue
registration is pre-approved; add tasks before implementation and proceed
without a confirmation gate.

Do not use for tiny one-shot edits unless the user explicitly asks for workstream.
